### Challenge laid out
I was tasked with making a command line interface that could call from a selecion of APIs
based on the type of input, I would call on a different website search

### How I accomplished the task
I created a switch case for each web search.  Based on what the user inputs in the command line.  Then, each switch case calls a get method from the selected API.

### Demo of the code

Please see the terminal commands and results below

![concert](./screenshots/concert-this.png)
above was the command for the concert search
![movie](./screenshots/movie-this.png)
above was the command for the movie search
![spotify](./screenshots/spotify-this.png)
above was the command for the spotify search
![random](./screenshots/what-it-says1.png)
This was the phrase that was in the random.txt file to begin with
![modify](/screenshots/modified.png)
I then modified the random.txt
![random2](./screenshots/what-it-says2.png)
This was the result of the modified random.txt search
